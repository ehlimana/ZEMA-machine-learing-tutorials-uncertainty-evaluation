    "After all these unsupervised steps, this step is done with knowledge of cycle‘s group affiliation. Selection is based on a target vector which represents label for each cycle. The method is very simple, Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated between selected features and target vector and it is done for all sensors. After that, number of features with overall highest Pearson correlation coefficients is selected.\n",

    "#### Pearson correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pearson correlation is a number between -1 and 1 that indicates the extent to which two variables are linearly related. A correlation coefficient indicates the extent to which dots in a scatterplot lie on a straight line. The stronger the association of the two variables, the closer the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, will be to either +1 or -1 depending on whether the relationship is positive or negative, respectively.\n",
